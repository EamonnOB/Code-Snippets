This was an exam question in college. The goal was to read in two files, the UK top 100 music chart, 
and the Irish top 100 music chart. Then, compare the two and make a list of the songs that were 
new to the Irish music charts, that weren't in the UK charts. This list had to be printed to the end user
as well as written to a new file called IrishNewEntries.txt.
