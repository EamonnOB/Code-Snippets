Two simple guessing games I created.

The first is a game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.
The end user then has to guess the number with a limited number of guesses.

The reverse guessing game is the same concept but this time the end user picks a number and the computer tries to guess it.
Again, the computer has a limited number of guesses which is decided by the end user(5, 7, or 9 guesses).
